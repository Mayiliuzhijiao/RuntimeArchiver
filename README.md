**Important Notice:**  
This open-source version of the plugin is no longer maintained. It may contain bugs and lack some features. I recommend using the **Fab version** for the most up-to-date features, bug fixes, and ongoing support. The Fab version is available [here](https://www.fab.com/listings/9bc46d5b-b9e1-4b93-aede-194619108265).
